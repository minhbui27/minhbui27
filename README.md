ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Minh
- I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at UCSB.
- I'm interested in all things robotics and cars. In my free time I like work on my car, and I'm making plans to create a full sized BB8 droid from Star Wars.
- When I'm unable to work on mechanical/electrical things, I'm learning full stack development. My current stack I'm using for my portfolio project (check out my github repo) includes ReactJS + Astro (currently in migration from create-react-app)
